# Goals for SVS Project

## Short term
1. ~~(Burn in), then have population adapt to specified optimum...~~  
2. ~~Load the data into R.~~  
3. ~~Plot the adaptive walk~~  
4. Plot hybrid between derived and ancestor in ~~python~~ & R
    + ~~Render parental chromosomes that are of identical length and shared mutations only at sites that are indentical-by-descent.~~
    + ~~Alternative is to specify that hybrid inherits each mutation with 50% chance UNLESS both parents have it (IBD).~~  
    + ~~After one of above complete, generate list of 'n' hybrids.~~ Import list into R... then plot!  
5. Assign hybrids a fitness value relative to parents (**New**)

## Longer term
1. Two separate populations adapting to same optimum
2. Plot their adaptive walks
3. Plot hybrid between two derived populations

## Extra long term
1. Analytical modelling of hybrid fitness… can we predict segregation variance? Can we predict fitness by angle?
2. Incorporate adaptation using ‘list’ of constrained mutations.
