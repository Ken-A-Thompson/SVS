# Goals

## Short term
1. (Burn in), then have population adapt to specified optimum...
2. Load the data into R.
3. Plot the adaptive walk
4. Plot hybrid between derived and ancestor

## Longer term
1. Two separate populations adapting to same optimum
2. Plot their adaptive walks
3. Plot hybrid between two derived populations

## Extra long term
1. Analytical modelling of hybrid fitness… can we predict segregation variance? Can we predict fitness by angle?
2. Incorporate adaptation using ‘list’ of constrained mutations.
