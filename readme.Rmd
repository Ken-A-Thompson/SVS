### Background

Models of ecological speciation (when natural selection generates reproductive isolation between independently evolving populations) typically assume that populations adapt only from new mutation, and that these mutations drawn from an effectively infinite random distribution. However, empirical studies of adaptation demonstrate that much adaptation (especially rapid adaptation) is from standing genetic variation, and also that the number of possible mutations is a 'list' (i.e., finite and discrete) rather than a continuous distribution. In this project our goal is to understand how more realistic modelling of the process of adaptation affect the evolution of reproductive isolation.

One striking result from models is that reproductive isolation evolves at the same rate when allopatric populations adapt to divergent optima as it does when they undergo parallel evolution to the same optimum. However, data from nature suggest that this is not the case. [[To be continued]]

## Running simulations
To run the simulation make sure Python is installed and type "python sgvCode.py" in terminal while in the SVS directory. To plot the data type "python sgvPlot.py". The resulting data and image files will be in the data folder.
