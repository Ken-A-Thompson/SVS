# Standing Genetic Variation & Speciation (SVS)
## Ken A. Thompson, Matthew M. Osmond, Dolph Schluter

### Background

Models of ecological speciation (when natural selection generates reproductive isolation between independently evolving populations) typically assume that populations adapt only from new mutation, and that these mutations drawn from an effectively infinite random distribution. However, empirical studies of adaptation demonstrate that much adaptation (especially rapid adaptation) is from standing genetic variation, and also that the number of possible mutations is a 'list' (i.e., finite and discrete) rather than a continuous distribution. The goal of this project was to understand how incorporating standing variation into models of 'speciation-by-selection' affects our predictions about the evolution of reproductive isolation.

### Reproducing this study

To plot the data we used in the paper, simply open the included R project, and use the script in the 'scripts' folder.

To re-run simulations, first install python on your machine. Then simply use python to execute the figure-specific scripts. On a Mac, open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts ('SVS' folder).

```
cd Documents/Projects/SVS
```

Still in terminal, execute a particular script (here the script generating data for Fig. 2).

```
python sgv.Fig2.py
```

This data is now ready to visualize.
